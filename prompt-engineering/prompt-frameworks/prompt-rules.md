1. **Define the problem or goal**:
   Clearly articulate what you want ChatGPT to help you with and what kind of
   response you are looking for.
2. **Use relevant keywords and phrases**: Input the most useful industry and topic-related terms into the prompt,
   which will help guide ChatGPT toward generating the desired response.
3. **Write the prompt**: Craft a concise prompt that clearly communicates the information and task that is required,
   using the keywords and phrases identified in steps 1 and 2.
4. **Test, evaluate, and iterate**: Generate responses with ChatGPT, evaluate the results, and adjust the prompt as
   necessary to elicit the desired response. Repeat the process until a successful prompt is created that
   consistently generates the desired response.
